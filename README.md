# verilog-car-dashboard
The goal of this project was to design a car dashboard interface that allows us to spin a car tire.  The dashboard would have all of the basic functions of a car dashboard, allowing the user to test the car tire in different situations.  Taking my design and applying it to a real world application, companies could use my car dashboard to test different tire and rim combinations to see which set gives them the best performance.  They could also add weather and road conditions in testing, since the dashboard simulates one car tire.  This style of testing is a lot cheaper and would save companies money.  Rather than testing entire vehicles for road performance, some tests can be isolated to the singular tire test.
